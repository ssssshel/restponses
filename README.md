# Restponses
Restponses is a library that allows you to easily generate clear and concise responses for your APIs. If your project is small, you don't have so clear your business rules, or you just don't want to worry about status codes, default messages and the nomenclature of the fields of your endpoints responses, then **Restponses** is for you :).

### Get Started

Restponses has been developed totally with typescript, so you don't have to worry about installing any @types dependencies
